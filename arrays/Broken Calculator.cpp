/*
Andrew was attempting a mathematics test where he needed to solve problems with factorials. One such problem had an answer which equaled 100! ,He wondered what would this number look like. He tried to calculate 100! On his scientific calculator but failed to get a correct answer. Can you write a code to help Andrew calculate factorials of such large numbers?

Input Format
a single lined integer N

Constraints
1 < = N < = 500

Output Format
Print the factorial of N

Sample Input
5
Sample Output
120
Explanation
for factorial of 5 we have 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

The following is a detailed algorithm for finding factorial.

factorial(n)
1) Create an array ‘res[]’ of MAX size where MAX is number of maximum digits in output.
2) Initialize value stored in ‘res[]’ as 1 and initialize ‘res_size’ (size of ‘res[]’) as 1.
3) Do following for all numbers from x = 2 to n.
……a) Multiply x with res[] and update res[] and res_size to store the multiplication result.

How to multiply a number ‘x’ with the number stored in res[]?
The idea is to use simple school mathematics. We one by one multiply x with every digit of
res[]. The important point to note here is digits are multiplied from rightmost digit to
eftmost digit. If we store digits in same order in res[], then it becomes difficult to
update res[] without extra space. That is why res[] is maintained in reverse way, i.e., digits
from right to left are stored.

multiply(res[], x)
1) Initialize carry as 0.
2) Do following for i = 0 to res_size – 1
….a) Find value of res[i] * x + carry. Let this value be prod.
….b) Update res[i] by storing last digit of prod in it.
….c) Update carry by storing remaining digits in carry.
3) Put all digits of carry in res[] and increase res_size by number of digits in carry.

Example to show working of multiply(res[], x)
A number 5189 is stored in res[] as following.
res[] = {9, 8, 1, 5}
x = 10

Initialize carry = 0;

i = 0, prod = res[0]*x + carry = 9*10 + 0 = 90.
res[0] = 0, carry = 9

i = 1, prod = res[1]*x + carry = 8*10 + 9 = 89
res[1] = 9, carry = 8

i = 2, prod = res[2]*x + carry = 1*10 + 8 = 18
res[2] = 8, carry = 1

i = 3, prod = res[3]*x + carry = 5*10 + 1 = 51
res[3] = 1, carry = 5

res[4] = carry = 5

res[] = {0, 9, 8, 1, 5}
