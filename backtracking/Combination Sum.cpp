/*
Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

 

Example 1:

Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.
Example 2:

Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
Example 3:

Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
Output: []
Example 4:

Input: candidates = [1], target = 1
Output: [[1]]
Example 5:

Input: candidates = [1], target = 2
Output: [[1,1]]
 

Constraints:

1 <= candidates.length <= 30
1 <= candidates[i] <= 200
All elements of candidates are distinct.
1 <= target <= 500

/*
Since the problem is to get all the possible results, not the best or the number of result, thus we donâ€™t need to consider DP(dynamic programming), recursion is needed to handle it.

We should use the following algorithm. 

1. Sort the array(non-decreasing).
2. First remove all the duplicates from array.
3. Then use recursion and backtracking to solve 
   the problem.
   (A) If at any time sub-problem sum == 0 then 
       add that array to the result (vector of 
       vectors).
   (B) Else if sum is negative then ignore that 
       sub-problem.
   (C) Else insert the present array in that 
       index to the current vector and call 
       the function with sum = sum-ar[index] and
       index = index, then pop that element from 
       current index (backtrack) and call the 
       function with sum = sum and index = index+1
